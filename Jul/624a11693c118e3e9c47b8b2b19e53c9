Wala is the result of the lack of a central data platform for African equity markets that Yemane came across in his own trading activities. “I had to look for data in different places. While several companies claimed to offer modern and accessible African investment research platforms, I found their products lacking,” Yemane explains. In addition to company data and news, the platform offers features such as an AI-based company sentiment tracker and a backtester for fundamental and technical indicators, a useful tool to identify trading opportunities. Wala’s charts and dashboards allow users to interpret data and turn it into information. Visit Wala now: https://wala.exchange/
