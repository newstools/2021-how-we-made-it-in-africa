Listen on Google Podcasts  Thank you to MFS Africa for their sponsorship of this series of conversational episodes. MFS Africa’s competition is with cash, and throughout this series we’ll feature other startups and entrepreneurs who are digitising, better organising, and aggregating analog and fragmented industries. On October 15, 2020, Paystack and Stripe announced the acquisition of the former by the latter, in a deal reported to be worth over $200 million. Adegoke Olubusi is currently sacrificing the luxury of sleep because the company can't stay ahead of the demand for its products. In an uncertain world, where do you look for opportunities for investment? In this episode, we unpack the talent and recruiting situation for venture-backed startups and growth-stage companies. How the deal came together, why it makes sense, and what it means, both for the two companies and their stakeholders. In this episode of The Flip, Justin Norman speaks to tech entrepreneurs from across Africa about geographic expansion.
